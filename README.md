# NBack Overview
Dual N-Back task consists of a sequence of signals shown to you one by one.

There are two types of signals in Dual N-Back (that's why Dual N-Back has "Dual" in its name):

**audio signals** — these are the alphabet letter sounds.
**visual signals** — these are the blue squares shown on the training field
 

In the process of training you have to match signals shown to you now to signals shown earlier. This is where N-Back comes to a game.

For Dual 1-Back you have to match the current signal with signal shown on the previous step (one back); for Dual 2-Back - with the signal shown before previous (two back), etc.

**You can change easily N inside the code by finding nBack variable. The same goes for timeout with nBackTimout variable.**

The game goes infitely (until you run out of RAM lol).
